Perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset of your choice, such as the Titanic dataset from Kaggle. Explore the relationships between variables and identify patterns and trends in the data.

To perform data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, follow these steps:

1. Data Cleaning:
Load the Dataset: Start by importing the Titanic dataset into a DataFrame.
Check for Missing Values: Identify any missing or null values and decide how to handle them (either by imputing, dropping, or other methods).
Check for Duplicates: Look for duplicate rows and remove them if necessary.
Correct Data Types: Ensure that columns have appropriate data types (e.g., Age should be numeric, Survived should be categorical).
Outlier Detection: Detect any obvious outliers in the dataset and decide if they should be removed or handled.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
Descriptive Statistics: Use summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) to understand the basic properties of numerical columns.
Data Visualization:
Distribution of Features: Visualize the distribution of numerical variables like Age, Fare, etc.
Categorical Variables: Visualize the distribution of categorical variables (e.g., Survived, Pclass, Sex, Embarked).
Correlation: Use a heatmap or scatter plots to analyze the correlation between numerical variables.
Survival Rate by Categories: Explore survival rates based on different features, such as Sex, Pclass, Age, and Embarked.
